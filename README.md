## Introduction

A set of tools for building high diversity ensembles.

* a set of quantitative metrics for assessing the quality of ensembles;
* a suite of baseline diversity metrics and optimized diversity metrics for identifying and selecting ensembles with high diversity and high quality;
* representative ensemble consensus methods: soft voting (model averaging), majority voting, plurality voting and boosting voting.
